# Analysis of Student Perfomance Factors 

## Introduction
This is a comprehensive analysis of student perfomance, gauged by the dependent variable (Exam Score) compared by the contributions of independent variables (See below variables).

## About the DataSet
The data is sourced from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams/">Kaggle</a>. The data is a <em>synthetic</em> dataset meant for skills-training purposes. 

## Contributors 
The original RMD file was in conjunction with Ekene Ikeora, Agyei Osei Duodu, and Stephen Opoku Bonsu. 

## Analysis 
We perfomed multi-linear regression analysis to determine the impact of each independent variable to the mobility of the dependent variable using R programming language.  

## Conclusions 
We conclude that Hours Studied, Attendance (%), Access to Resources, Parental Involvement, and Previous Scores have statistically significant effects on the outcome of Exam Scores, with p-values less than 2Ã—10-16. The overall model is significant and explains 85.8% of the variance in the Exam Score. To quantify their contribution towards the resulting exam score, for every; extra hour studied, there is a 0.291% increase in the exam score, extra (%) Attendance, there is a 0.199% increase in the exam score, increase in access to resources (from low to medium to high), exam scores improve by 0.962%, additional parental involvement (from low to medium to high), there is a 0.982% increase in the exam score, extra (%) in the previous scores, there is a 0.047% increase in the exam score, given that all the other variables remain constant for each of these cases.
